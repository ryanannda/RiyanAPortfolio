                            <p>This analysis report provides a comprehensive overview of traffic accident incidents, with a total of 26,214 incident records and 54,109 vehicles and entities involved, collected during the period from January 1 to December 31, 2024. The objective of this analysis is to identify key trends, patterns of occurrence, and factors contributing to accidents, thereby providing valuable insights for road safety decision-making.</p>

                            <h4 class="blog-title"><a>Analysis Structure</a></h4>
                            <p>Based on the visualization of traffic accident data from January 1 to December 31, 2024, here are some insights and analyses that can be taken:</p>   
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Total Accidents and Units Involved include:
                                        Total number of accidents (record count): 26,214 incidents.
                                        Number of vehicle units involved (unit numbers): 54,109 units.
                                        The accident trend is relatively stable throughout the year, with slight differences.</li>
                                    <li>The type of accident involving accidents without injuries or only minor damage and accident cases with injuries or vehicles having to be towed have a fairly significant number, averaging more than 2,000 incidents per month.</li>
                                    <li>The main cause of the most accidents is "Unable to Define" with 7,929 cases, indicating the possibility of a lack of data or incomplete investigation. Then Traffic violations cause other main causes, such as: Failure to give the right of way (5,695 cases), Overtaking too close (2,001 cases), Violating traffic signs (1,851 cases), Errors when turning/not giving signals (1,638 cases), Weather factors (only 237 cases related to bad weather such as rain or snow) indicate that most accidents are more influenced by driver behavior than environmental factors.</li>
                                    <li>The type of road at a four-way intersection is the location of the most accidents. Undivided roads and T-intersections also have high crash rates.</li>
                                    <li>Dry road conditions dominate crashes, meaning crashes are more likely to be caused by human factors than road conditions.
                                        Only a small percentage of crashes occur on icy, icy, or wet road conditions.</li>
                                    <li>Most major crashes occur during the day (64.1%), indicating that visibility is not a major factor in most crashes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="blog-title"><a>Conclusion and Recommendations</a></h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Since the majority of accidents are caused by driving behavior, it is essential to increase road safety campaigns and traffic law enforcement, and to enforce stricter laws against violations such as violating traffic signs, failing to yield, and following too closely.
                                        Traffic Infrastructure Improvement</li>
                                    <li>Given that four-way intersections are the location of the most accidents, evaluating intersection designs, installing more effective traffic lights, and clearer road markings can help reduce accidents.</li>
                                    <li>Since 24% of accidents occur on roads with poor lighting, it is necessary to improve street lighting in accident-prone areas.</li>
                                    <li>With the high number of accidents with "undetermined" causes, there is a need to improve accident data recording so that more accurate actions can be taken to prevent accidents.</li>
                                </ul>
