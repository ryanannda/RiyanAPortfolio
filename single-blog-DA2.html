                                        <li>Leverage Google for low-budget campaigns with a focus on clicks.</li>
                                        <li>Use LinkedIn for campaigns targeting professionals or B2B.</li>
                                        <li>Allocate more budget to Instagram and Facebook due to their high performance and competitive CPCs.</li> 
                                        <li>Set aside some budget for YouTube to build engagement, but avoid relying on it for primary conversions.</li>

                                        <li>Image, Story, and Carousel content types had almost the same number of successes (191, 191, and 190 respectively), indicating that these three types of content were the most effective in engaging audiences.
                                            Text (172) and Video (153) content lagged slightly behind, but still performed well.</li>
                                        <li>YouTube (199) and LinkedIn (188) platforms generated the highest number of successes, indicating that both were very effective platforms for campaigns. Facebook (177) and Instagram (175) performed similarly, but slightly lower than YouTube and LinkedIn.
                                            Google had the lowest performance with 158 successes, indicating that there is a need for further optimization on this platform.</li>
                                        <li>The UK (198) region had the highest successes, followed by the US (181) and Germany (178), indicating good campaign performance in developed markets.
                                            India (173) and Canada (167) had smaller, but still significant, contributions.
                                            The regions with the highest successes are likely to be the main targets for future campaigns, while regions with lower successes can be the focus of strategy improvements.</li>
